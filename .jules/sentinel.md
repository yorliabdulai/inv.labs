## 2024-05-24 - Server Action IDOR and Parameter Tampering
**Vulnerability:** The `executeStockTrade` server action blindly trusted client-provided `userId`, `price`, `totalCost`, and `fees` parameters. This enabled Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), allowing users to execute trades on behalf of others, and parameter tampering, allowing users to manipulate stock prices and avoid trading fees.
**Learning:** Next.js Server Actions act as open API endpoints. Accepting sensitive IDs or calculation results from the client without server-side re-verification creates critical security bypasses.
**Prevention:** Always authenticate the caller securely via `supabase.auth.getUser()` inside the server action. Recalculate all financial amounts, fees, and real-time prices server-side instead of relying on client-side calculations.
